# elim_draft_data
Holds data from the 2023 FCE Eliminator Drafts, gathered with the GOAT package ffscrapr. Leagues are private by default so this only includes leagues I'm in or have been added to as a co-manager. This is nearly all of them though, mostly excludes unique formats like blind bid, rookie only etc
